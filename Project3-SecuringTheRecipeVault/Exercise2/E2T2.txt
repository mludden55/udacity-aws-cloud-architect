1.9 	Ensure IAM password policy requires minimum password length of 14 or greater
1.11 	Ensure IAM password policy expires passwords within 90 days or less
2.9		Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs
2.6 	Ensure S3 bucket access logging is enabled on the CloudTrail S3 bucket
4.1		Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
4.2		Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
S3.4 	S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
EC2.9 	EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Remove public access for ports 20,21,23,67,68,546,547
Specify a more rigorous IAM password policy
Enable VPC flow logging
Enable access logging on CloudTrail S3 bucket
Provide specific IP address range for security groups ingress on port 22
Provide specific IP address range for security groups ingress on port 3389
Encrypt S3 buckets
Remove public access for EC2 instances
