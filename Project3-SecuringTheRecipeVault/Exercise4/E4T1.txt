# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
1. Change the security group settings so that ssh connections are not allowed from the internet.
2. Disable the ability to use SSH password login on the application server instance.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
1. Implement least privilege access on "InstanceRolePolicy-C3". Currently the roll has full access to all S3 resources.
2. Limit access to only the free recipes bucket.
