Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The c3-app-InstanceRole-18IBL9L5R85Q3 for the IAM Role allows for S3 actions on any resource.

This means that the IAM role could be used to access and change content in any S3 bucket in the AWS account.

# Poor practice 2
For the VPC configuration, all of the route definitions have DestinationCidrBlock defined as 0.0.0.0/0.

If an attacker was able to breach into the subnet configured within the routing table they could have the option to tranfer information to any IP address within the VPC.
